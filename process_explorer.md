### Step 1: Download and Launch Process Explorer

* **Get Process Explorer:**  
  Visit the Microsoft Sysinternals website and download the tool.
* **Extract Files:**  
  Unzip the downloaded package into a dedicated folder.
* **Run as Administrator:**  
  Open the folder and launch `procexp64.exe` or `procexp.exe` by right-clicking and selecting **Run as Administrator**.

### Step 2: Explore the Interface

Process Explorer displays processes in a hierarchical tree structure. Each process is **color-coded** based on its status:

| Color | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pink** | Suspended processes  |
| **Light Blue** | Processes running under your account  |
| **Dark Blue** | System services or processes  |
| **Green** | Newly started processes  |
| **Red** | Recently terminated processes  |

### Step 3: Spotting Suspicious Processes 

To investigate potentially harmful processes:

1. **Check Unknown Processes:**  
   Look for unfamiliar names. Trusted processes usually come from known vendors like Microsoft, Adobe, or Intel. 
2. **Verify Digital Signatures:**  
   Right-click → **Properties** → **Image** tab. Check for a valid **Digital Signature**. Unsigned processes may be risky. 
3. **Examine File Paths:**  
   Check the **Path** under the Image tab. Legitimate system processes are usually in `C:\Windows\System32`. Running from temp or user folders is suspicious. 
4. **Monitor Resource Usage:**  
   Watch for processes consuming excessive CPU, memory, or disk resources without explanation.
5. **Review Process Details:**  
   Lack of description or unclear company names can indicate a suspicious process.
6. **Inspect Network Activity:**  
   Right-click → **Properties** → **TCP/IP** tab. Unexpected external connections require attention.

### Step 4: Research Suspicious Processes

* Search the process name online (e.g., `cmd.exe`) to learn more about it. 
* Use databases like **VirusTotal** or **ProcessLibrary** to check for known malware.

### Step 5: Handle Malicious or Unwanted Processes

* **Terminate:** Right-click → **Kill Process** to stop it immediately.  
* **Suspend:** Right-click → **Suspend** to pause execution temporarily.  
* **Delete Source:** Locate the executable via its Path and remove it if confirmed malicious.
